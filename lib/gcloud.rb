# = Google Cloud
#
# Gcloud is the official library for interacting with the Google Cloud Platform.
# Google Cloud Platform is a set of modular cloud-based services that allow
# you to create anything from simple websites to complex applications.
#
# Gcloud's goal is to provide a API that is familiar and comfortable to
# Rubyists. Authentication is handled by providing project and credential
# information, or if you are running on Google Compute Engine this configuration
# is taken care of for you.
#
# You can learn more about various options for connection on the
# {Authentication Guide}[AUTHENTICATION.md].
